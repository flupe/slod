**slod** is a tiny local webserver with live-reload.
That's all it does, and it does so fairly well.

To compile, run `cc -o slod slod.c` and put the binary in your `PATH`.

    Usage: slod [options] [ROOT]
      -h, --help       Show this help message and quit
      -p, --port PORT  Specify port to listen on
